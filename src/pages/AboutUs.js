          Established in the late 1960s, our family owned business is based in
          Edinburgh and Falkirk, but services customers across the UK.{" "}

          Our Edinburgh branch has the longest history as an audio retailer in
          the UK. During recent renovations, receipts were found from Nicolson’s
          Gramophone Saloon dating back to 1926. In the 1950s WG Graham took
          over the shop and renamed it WG Graham’s Hi-Fi Corner. Upon his
          retirement, Graham Tiso bought the business and shortened the name to
          Hi-Fi Corner.

          Soon thereafter a young enthusiastic Colin MacKenzie (left), who was
          recommended by Linn’s own Ivor Tiefenbrun, was employed to manage the
          shop; with a knack for business and years of experience in the hi-fi
          industry, Colin would later become the owner of Hi-Fi Corner. Today,
          Struan MacKenzie carries on the legacy as the company’s Managing
          Director.
